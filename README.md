# stupidspotscript

i kinda annotated the code (maybe).

i made this too long ago and didnt care enough to really annotate it.

its also way too late.


to add it to a given google sheet you do something like this
https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets

each sheet is a "project" and you can just add some scripts to the "project" for cool menus and whatnot
